    description:"Marshall Bruce Mathers III (born October 17, 1972), known professionally as Eminem (/ˌɛmɪˈnɛm/; stylized as EMINƎM), is an American rapper and record producer. He is credited with popularizing hip hop in middle America and is critically acclaimed as one of the greatest rappers of all time.[2] Eminem's global success and acclaimed works are widely regarded as having broken racial barriers for the acceptance of white rappers in popular music. While much of his transgressive work during the late 1990s and early 2000s made him widely controversial, he came to be a representation of popular angst of the American underclass and has been cited as an influence for many artists of various genres."

Relativity and quantum mechanics are together the two pillars of modern physics.[3][8] His mass energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory, has been dubbed the world's most famous equation.[9] His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science.[10][11] He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory.
